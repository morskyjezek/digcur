This repository holds materials for use in learning digital curation tools and concepts from archival and library perspectives.

## Lesson Concepts

These examples were proposed in 2018, during a first iteration of this repository.

* Extract and record technical metadata about files (name, location, size, dates, etc)
* Create preservation metadata, including file integrity and/or characterization, then record it in manifests for submission information packages.  
* API, data formats, transformation, presentation: Use web API service to pull data about digital collections (e.g., Gottlieb jazz photos), get a list, transform list into a js timeline tool format to show photos by year with thumbnails. Tools: browser, OpenRefine, timeline.js (or other)
* preparing, producing: bagging files with Bagger. Tools/specification: BagIt
* analyze, plan, ingest, integrity: generate metadata about a group of files, create checksums, validate; basic metadata checking and transformation using structured output/bag from Data Accessioner. Tools: Data Accessioner
* metadata recording, transformation: record metadata in a spreadsheet, generate XML encoding, transform to display with XSLT. Tools: spreadsheets, python to generate XML, develop an XSLT transform to display on the web.
