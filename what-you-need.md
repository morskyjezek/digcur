# Resources

## Things you'll need

* A text editor that helps you with code and markup
  * Examples: [Atom](https://atom.io/) (various), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows), [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) (Mac), [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) (Mac)
  * Some of these editors, like Atom, will allow you to interact directly with a Git repository, to networks via FTP/SFTP, or other means, so that you can edit remote files.
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution with the latest version of Python, which includes tools for writing python code and also jupyter notebooks.
* If you're using a web browser like Chrome, you may want to download an extension to help display and parse JSON. To find one, just search for json at the Chrome extension store. Some browsers, like Firefox, will display JSON in a more readable format without an extension.
  * Example: [JSON Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-viewer/aimiinbnnkboelefkjlenlgimcabobli), etc.
* [Open Refine](http://openrefine.org/download.html), a free tool for manipulating data, it will run in your browser but you may need to follow this guide to get it up and running
* [Bagger](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagger#installing), a free tool for packaging data, which will create a metadata file, manifest of contents, and generate integrity information (checksums); this tool will also require [Java](https://java.com/)
* A healthy outlook of exploration and self-sufficiency. Things won't always work as you think they will or as explained, sometimes breaking things is a way to learn. So don't worry if you get some error messages, things don't work out on the first try, or there are some frustrations along the way. Exploration is part of the learning process.
* Patience. Testing and troubleshooting can be frustrating and time consuming, so sometimes you may just need to [trust that you're moving in the right direction](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/things-i-wish-someone-had-told-me-when-i-was-learning-how-to-code-565fc9dcb329), and also because tools and collections will continually be changing, so there is [always something new to learn](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/this-is-what-ive-gathered-after-a-year-of-teaching-myself-to-code-9e46bb60db9)

## Python
You should be working in a version of Python 3.X.

* For a general overview of Python, with special attention to the needs of information professionals, [Python 4 Everyone](https://www.py4e.com/) by Charles Severance is a useful resource.
* If you are running Windows, see these [instructions from Python 4 Everyone](https://www.py4e.com/software-win.php).
* If you are running a Mac, you should already have python. More information at [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/software-mac.php); if you don't have Python 3, check [here](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/osx/).  
* Here is documentation about [managing packages](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#ensure-you-can-run-pip-from-the-command-line); one tool to do this on Mac is [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

## Command Line
While not the most intuitive way to interact with your computer and files, learning how to interact with the command line can be a quick and efficient way to extract metadata and design batch processes. While it may take a bit of practice to pick up, command line basics can be useful. You can use the [Command Line module to explore basics](/activities/exercise-command-line.md).

Here are a few other resources:  

* [Command Line Crash Course](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html) from _Learn Python the Hard Way_.
* [Script Ahoy!](https://github.com/dd388/crals) offers explanations of many command line operations and [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) scripting.
* [ffmproviser](https://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr/) a bash resource for running AV operations using FFmpeg
* [explainshell.com](https://explainshell.com/) an interactive resource that can help you to understand and analyze combinations of shell commands
