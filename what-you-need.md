# Resources

## Some things you'll need

* A text editor that helps you with code and markup
  * Examples: [Atom](https://atom.io/) (various), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows), [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) (Mac), [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) (Mac)
* [Open Refine](http://openrefine.org/download.html), a free tool for manipulating data, it will run in your browser but you may need to follow this guide to get it up and running
* [Bagger](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagger#installing), a free tool for packaging data, which will create a metadata file, manifest of contents, and generate integrity information (checksums); this tool will also require [Java](https://java.com/) 
* A healthy outlook of exploration and self-sufficiency. Things won't always work as you think they will or as explained, sometimes breaking things is a way to learn. So don't worry if you get some error messages, things don't work out on the first try, or there are some frustrations along the way. Exploration is part of the learning process. 
* Patience

## Python
You should be working in a version of Python 3.X. 

* For a general overview of Python, with special attention to the needs of information professionals, [Python 4 Everyone](https://www.py4e.com/) by Charles Severance is a useful resource.
* If you are running Windows, see these [instructions from Python 4 Everyone](https://www.py4e.com/software-win.php).
* If you are running a Mac, you should already have python. More information at [Python 4 Everyone](https://www.py4e.com/software-mac.php); if you don't have Python 3, check [here](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/osx/).  
* Here is documentation about [managing packages](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#ensure-you-can-run-pip-from-the-command-line); one tool to do this on Mac is [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

## Command Line
While not the most intuitive way to interact with your computer and files, once learned the command line offers a quick and efficient way to extract metadata and design batch processes. While it may take a bit to pick up, command line basics will only take a bit of time to learn. Here are a few resources:  

* [Command Line Crash Course](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html) from _Learn Python the Hard Way_.
* [Script Ahoy!](https://github.com/dd388/crals) offers explanations of many command line operations and [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) scripting. 

## Additional tutorials that try to do similar things, in archives, libraries, &c.

* [Storybench](http://www.storybench.org/about-storybench/)
* [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/)
