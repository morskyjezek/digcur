# Here's some things you'll need

* A text editor that helps you with code and markup
  * Examples: Notepad++ (Windows), [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) (Mac), [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) (Mac)
* A healthy outlook of exploration and self-sufficiency. Things won't always work as you think they will or as explained, sometimes breaking things is a way to learn. So don't worry if you get some error messages, things don't work out on the first try, or there are some frustrations along the way. Exploration is part of the learning process. 

# A few general tutorials that try to do similar things in other areas
