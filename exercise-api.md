# Gathering Data with an API

## What is an API?

An API is an "Application Program Interface," which is basically a protocol that defines how data may be output, requested, and interchanged between different systems. So for example, if you want to get a bunch of information out of a library catalog, you can follow a set of standard request rules to get that data and pull it into your system or program. It can help to make data more open, or help to automate the process of receiving data. Do you, for example, use an app to tell when the next bus will come or find out if there are Metro alerts? It's likely that you are using an app that was designed by an organization that has access to the data provided by DC Metro and presents it in a different form or integrates it into a newsfeed. For example, [Is Metro on Fire?](https://ismetroonfire.com/) pulls its data from the WMATA API, [MetroHero](https://dcmetrohero.com/apis).
