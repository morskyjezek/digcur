# Using Git

Git is a versioning tool, which has become widely used for distributed code development and maintenance through shared respositories, like GitHub. It has also become increasingly widely used to share curricula, share and contribute to open drafts of educational materials and library projects, and a home for metadata tools and remediation examples. We will take a look at Git basics. See also the resources below.
