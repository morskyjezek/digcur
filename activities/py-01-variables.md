# Python 1: Expressions, Variables, Types, Inputs

### Python basics

Indentation is important in Python. Each line typically indicates an individual expression or statement of processing instructions. Lines that are indented indicate subroutines.

## Variables

## Statements

Statements are "unit[s] of code that the Python interpreter can execute" [py4e][]. Above, for example, the assignment of a value to a variable is an assignment statement. The functions, like `print()`, are also statements. Statements often correspond to the line or two of input that you might make use of
in interactive mode. Statements are often placed on a single line in python, while
dependent statements or conditionals that become part of a larger loop are placed
on the next line and indented. Various guides for the style of code writing in python are
given in the "Style Guide for Python Code" [PEP8][].

## Types

## Inputs

A few lines combination of expressions that asks for input and makes a calculation.
