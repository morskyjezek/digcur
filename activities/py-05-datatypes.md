# Python 5: Types of Data Objects in Python

This section briefly overviews various types of data objects that you may encounter or use in Python. It goes beyond the earlier discussion of variables, which only touches on strings, integers, and values. 

## More Complex Types

* string - a *sequence* of characters
* list - a mutable array of values, denoted by square brackets: ```[]```
* dictionary - a list of key-value pairs, denoted by curly brackets: ```{}```
* tuples - an efficient, immutable array of values, denoted by parentheses ```()```
