# Python 5: Types of Data Objects in Python

This section briefly overviews various types of data objects that you may encounter or use in Python. It goes beyond the earlier discussion of variables, which only touches on strings, integers, and values. 

## More Complex Types

* string - a *sequence* of characters, usually denoted by round brackets ```()```
* [list](https://www.py4e.com/html3/08-lists) - an indexed and mutable list of values, denoted by square brackets: ```[]```. Items can be indexed by their position (starting with 0), or by their value. 
* [dictionary](https://www.py4e.com/html3/09-dictionaries) - an array of key-value pairs, denoted by curly brackets: ```{}```
* [tuple](https://www.py4e.com/html3/10-tuples) - an efficient, immutable array of values, denoted by round brackets, with individual values set off by single quotes ```('a', 'b')```

To determine the type of an object, you can always use tye ```type()``` method.
