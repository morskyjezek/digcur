    "a program that will query information from a webpage, you need to be able to explain\n",
    "to Python how to interact with the hypertext protocol and ask for responses\n",
    "as a web browser would. For this case, you can \"import\" a library called `requests`. Additional \n",
    "libraries allow you to interact with information in the file system, as you \n",
    "would in the shell or command line, or to use specific types of data files, such as .csv. \n",
    "We will also make use of `csv` to process information in CSV files, `json` to use JSON, \n",
    "and `lxml` and/or `ETree` to process XML. \n",
    "\n",
