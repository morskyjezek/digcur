# Basics of Geospatial Information Visualization 

Geospatial data is processed and visualized by suites of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools. Such 
tools may capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, or present spatial or geographic data. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system "cited April 26, 2018")

GIS tools offer many opportunities for digital curators to manipulate and enhance information, as well as to visualize spatial information. 

## Setup

There are many tools available to work with geospatial data. In this activity, we will use tools provided by Google, including GoogleMaps and related tools. You will need a Google account to log in and use shared documents. We will start by using GoogleRefine to clean the data, import the data to a FusionTable, geocode the data, and map the information. 

To follow along the basics below, you can use the CSV data [linked here](../assets/FW06166-frogs-track-info-no-location.csv). This data contains a basic representation of the recordings of frog sounds made by the 

## Basic Operations

Let's walk through some basic geocoding operations.  

### Get and Analyze/Clean Data

[Use this CSV data](../assets/FW06166-frogs-track-info-no-location.csv)

### Import the Data

Bring the data into a new Fusion Table. 

### Geocode

FusionTables offer various ways to view the data, and also some useful manipulation tools. For the purposes of this activity, we are going to work on generating and applying location tags for each of the frog recordings. Note that some of the cells should be highlighted with yellow. This indicates that the table might find some geographical informaiton 

Through this process, you should be able to create a map like this: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FiQS9l1bP1exRK3FlZtVXsXYXK0&usp=sharing.
