# Basics of the Command Line Interface

Some of this section assumes using Mac OS/Unix style terminal commands. Please see [here](py4e on windows) and [here](BL guide from AVP) for greater detail on Windows. 

## Description

This activity aims to present basic skills for using the "[command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)" on Mac and Windows operating systems. A competent digital preservationist should have a basic level of comfort and competence with this interface for a few reasons: primarily because some tools require operation from the command line, but also because it can be a quick and efficient way to perform some actions, such as generating basic information about files and systems.

Keep in mind the difference between the command line and the visual interfaces that may seem more comfortable. We’re mostly used to interacting with computers via a GUI (sounds like “gooey”); that is, a Graphical User Interface that allows you to interact with the system visually, through clicking, dragging and dropping, pointing and tapping, etc. In some cases, such as word processors, we call this WYSIWYG (“what you see is what you get”), when what you see on the screen is comparable to what you would expect to see when the file is printed out on a page. In the command line interface (CLI), as when we are looking at markup files in a text editor, you can see what you do to get what you want. In some ways, it is a more transparent way to get a desired result because you have greater knowledge of what you have asked the computer to do, as well as what the computer is doing.

_Note: where you see “Mac” below, this generally designates a UNIX-wide command, “Windows” is generally DOS-like._ 

## Activities
Can you answer these questions? Open a window that gives you access to the command line:
* What is the name of the directory or folder that you are in?
* How would you move 
* Can you list the
