# Python 2: Conditional and Repetitive Code

## Introduction
Severance [identifies](https://www.py4e.com/html3/14-objects) four basic "programming patterns," which you might think about as building blocks for more complicated programs. 

* Sequential code
* Conditional code (if statements)
* Repetitive code (loops)
* Store and reuse (functions)

The [previous activity](py-01-variables.md) explored basic expressions and now we will move on to the more complex modes.
